## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use a mobile-first workflow and it was also useful as a practice for flexbox and grid.

Some code snippets:

```html
<div class="cards">
  <div class="cards__card cards__card--cyan">
    <h3>Supervisor</h3>
    <p>Monitors activity to identify project roadblocks</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/icon-supervisor.svg" alt="Glass with an eye" />
    </figure>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.cards {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 2em 1em;
  grid-template-areas:
    '. team-builder .'
    'supervisor team-builder calculator'
    'supervisor karma calculator'
    '. karma .';
  width: 70%;
}
```
